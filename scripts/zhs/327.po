msgid "0:優愛が、判や百瀬との話を終えてフリージアを出たときには、空はすっかり闇に包まれていた。[%p]"
msgstr "0:By the time Yua finished her conversation with Momose and Ban left Freesia, the sky was dark.[%p]"

msgid "100:判と百瀬には、これまで優愛が調べてきた西條拓巳に関する疑惑を、すべて洗いざらい話した。[%p]"
msgstr "100:She'd told them everything she suspected about Takumi Nishijo, and showed them all the research she'd done.[%p]"

msgid "200:刑事と、調査会社の社長。その２人に優愛の考えを認めてもらえば、警察も西條拓巳逮捕に動いてくれるかもしれない――そんな期待があった。[%p]"
msgstr "200:A police detective and the head of a private investigation company. If the two of them could be persuaded, the police might go to arrest Takumi Nishijo. Or at least, she'd hoped so.[%p]"

msgid "300:西條拓巳は逮捕されるべきだ。彼の苦しみは理解できているつもりなのでできれば自首してほしかったが、本人が拒絶する以上、警察に動いてもらうしかない。それが優愛の考え。[%p]"
msgstr "300:Takumi Nishijo needed to be arrested. She knew how much he was suffering, so she wanted him to turn himself in. But since he wasn't willing to, she'd have to get the police to arrest him. That had been what she'd thought, anyway.[%p]"

msgid "400:しかし意外にも、判刑事は“西條拓巳は容疑者から外された”と言った。優愛にとってそれは信じられないことだったし、認めたくないことだった。[%p]"
msgstr "400:But surprisingly, Ban had told her that Takumi Nishijo wasn't a suspect anymore. It was unbelievable, something she didn't want to accept.[%p]"

msgid "500:なぜ自分の推察を否定するのか。西條拓巳がニュージェネ事件の犯人なのは明らかなのに。[%p]"
msgstr "500:Why would they refuse to believe her theory? It was so clear that Takumi Nishijo was behind the murders.[%p]"

msgid "600:唇を噛みながら、優愛は足早に駅へと急いだ。[%p]"
msgstr "600:Yua bit her lip and headed toward the station at a fast pace.[%p]"

msgid "700:早く帰って、さらに詳しく事件について調べ、決定的な証拠を手に入れるんだ。[%p]"
msgstr "700:She needed to get home and do more research. She needed to find proof they couldn't ignore.[%p]"

msgid "800:それを判刑事に突きつけて、自分が正しいって証明するんだ――[%p]"
msgstr "800:Then she'd show it to Ban and prove she was right.[%p]"

msgid "900:[name]諏訪[line]「あっれ〜？　楠さんのところのお嬢さんじゃないッスか！」[%p]"
msgstr "900:[name]諏訪[line]Oh? If it isn't young Miss Kusunoki![%p]"

msgid "1000:不意に声をかけられて、優愛はビクッと身を震わせ、立ち止まった。[%p]"
msgstr "1000:Someone called her name out of nowhere. She jerked a little, and then stopped moving.[%p]"

msgid "1100:――最近の渋谷は物騒だから、夜に女子１人で出歩かないように。[%p]"
msgstr "1100:—Shibuya's not safe these days. Girls, make sure you're not out alone at night.[%p]"

msgid "1200:学校のホームルームで担任がそう言ってたことを思い出し、優愛は身を固くした。[%p]"
msgstr "1200:She remembered the teacher telling her that during homeroom, and froze stiff.[%p]"

msgid "1300:声をかけてきたのは、人懐っこそうな、若い男だった。[%p]"
msgstr "1300:The man who'd called out to her was young and friendly looking.[%p]"

msgid "1400:[name]男[line]「確か、優愛ちゃんッスよね」[%p]"
msgstr "1400:[name]男[line]You're Yua, aren't you?[%p]"

msgid "1500:[name]優愛[line]「あの……？」[%p]"
msgstr "1500:[name]優愛[line]Um?[%p]"

msgid "1600:この男に、どこかで見覚えはある。だが優愛はとっさに思い出せなかった。[%p]"
msgstr "1600:She recognized him from somewhere, but she couldn't remember where.[%p]"

msgid "1700:[name]諏訪[line]「うわ、覚えてないッスか。自分、諏訪護って言いまス。ほら、こういう者ッスよ」[%p]"
msgstr "1700:[name]諏訪[line]Uwah, you don't remember me, huh? The name's Mamoru Suwa. Here, look.[%p]"

msgid "1800:男は、懐から優愛にだけ見えるように警察手帳をかざし、すぐにしまった。[%p]"
msgstr "1800:He pulled out a police badge from his pocket, just high enough for her and nobody else to see. Then he quickly put it away.[%p]"

msgid "1900:[name]諏訪[line]「『集団ダイブ』の後、一度楠さんのお宅にうかがったこと、ありまスよ。その時に、優愛ちゃんともいろいろお話したんスけどねえ」[%p]"
msgstr "1900:[name]諏訪[line]I went to your house after the Group Dive. You and I spoke for quite a bit.[%p]"

msgid "2000:[name]優愛[line]「す、すいません。思い出しました。その節は、どうも……」[%p]"
msgstr "2000:[name]優愛[line]S-Sorry... I remember now. Uh... nice to see you again.[%p]"

msgid "2100:優愛はペコリと頭を下げた。[%p]"
msgstr "2100:Yua bowed to him.[%p]"

msgid "2200:当時は事件直後でひどく動揺していて、諏訪の顔も実はよく覚えていない。[%p]"
msgstr "2200:She'd been a mess after the incident. She didn't remember his face at all.[%p]"

msgid "2300:ただ、あの時刑事に話相手になってもらったおかげで、優愛は妹の死の不可解さについて整理することができた。そういう点ではこの刑事に感謝していた。[%p]"
msgstr "2300:But she did remember a detective who was nice enough to listen to everything she had to say. That was the conversation where she'd realized how bizarre her sister's death was. In that respect, she was grateful to him.[%p]"

msgid "2400:[name]諏訪[line]「さっきまで、判刑事と一緒だったんじゃないッスか？」[%p]"
msgstr "2400:[name]諏訪[line]You were just with Ban a moment ago, weren't you?[%p]"

msgid "2500:[name]優愛[line]「え？　判さんと、お知り合いなんですか？」[%p]"
msgstr "2500:[name]優愛[line]Huh? You know Ban?[%p]"

msgid "2600:[name]諏訪[line]「そりゃ、同じ警視庁捜査一課ッスから。自分の先輩ッスよ、いつも怒られてまス」[%p]"
msgstr "2600:[name]諏訪[line]Sure, we're both part of Section 1. He's my partner. He's always getting mad at me for something or other.[%p]"

msgid "2700:[name]諏訪[line]「よっぽど若い女の子と話せるのが嬉しかったんスねえ」[%p]"
msgstr "2700:[name]諏訪[line]He must've been really happy to talk to a young girl.[%p]"

msgid "2800:[name]諏訪[line]「ここだけの話ッスけど、今日、優愛ちゃんと会うって自分に教えてくれたときの先輩、鼻の下伸ばしちゃって、どう見てもスケベオヤジって感じだったッス」[%p]"
msgstr "2800:[name]諏訪[line]Don't tell him I told you this, but when he was talking about meeting you today, he had this look on his face like a perverted old man.[%p]"

msgid "2900:[name]優愛[line]「あはは……」[%p]"
msgstr "2900:[name]優愛[line]Ahahah...[%p]"

msgid "3000:[name]諏訪[line]「できれば自分も同席したかったんスけど、捜査から抜け出せなくて」[%p]"
msgstr "3000:[name]諏訪[line]I wish I could've gone with him, but I couldn't get away from the investigation.[%p]"

msgid "3100:[name]諏訪[line]「そうそう、優愛ちゃんのご両親には連絡行ってるんスかねえ。たぶん行ってると思うんスけど。ん〜、どうかな〜」[%p]"
msgstr "3100:[name]諏訪[line]Oh, right. Have your parents been told yet? I assume they have. Or, hmm... Maybe they haven't?[%p]"

msgid "3200:[name]優愛[line]「連絡、と言いますと……？」[%p]"
msgstr "3200:[name]優愛[line]Told what?[%p]"

msgid "3300:[name]諏訪[line]「ああ、いや、『集団ダイブ』のね、犯人が使ったと思われる遺留品が見つかったんスよ」[%p]"
msgstr "3300:[name]諏訪[line]Oh, we found something we think was used by the killer in the Group Dive case.[%p]"

msgid "3400:[name]優愛[line]「え……、ほ、本当ですか！？」[%p]"
msgstr "3400:[name]優愛[line]Huh? R-Really?[%p]"

msgid "3500:優愛には、そんな話は初耳だった。[linebreak]ついつい、諏訪に詰め寄ってしまう。[%p]"
msgstr "3500:Yua hadn't heard anything about this. She found herself edging closer to him.[%p]"

msgid "3600:[name]諏訪[line]「ええ。どんなものだと思うッスか？　まあ、最近別の事件でマスコミが散々取り上げてるんで、有名だと思うんスけど。なんと、ダーススパイダーのヘルメットッス！」[%p]"
msgstr "3600:[name]諏訪[line]Yes. Want to guess what it is? The media's been talking about it all the time lately because of another case, so I bet you could if you tried. Get this: It's a Darth Spider helmet![%p]"

msgid "3700:[name]優愛[line]「それを……『集団ダイブ』の犯人も、かぶっていたんですか？」[%p]"
msgstr "3700:[name]優愛[line]And the killer behind the Group Dive murder... was wearing it?[%p]"

msgid "3800:[name]諏訪[line]「そう。ネットに事件の様子を撮影したビデオが流出したッスよね？　あれを解析した結果、分かったんスよ〜」[%p]"
msgstr "3800:[name]諏訪[line]Yup. There was that video that went online, right? We ran a bunch of analyses on it and found that out.[%p]"

msgid "3900:[name]諏訪[line]「それにしても、ダーススパイダーと言えば、例の渋谷エスパー騒動の少年が有名ッスよね。西條拓巳くん、でしたっけ？」[%p]"
msgstr "3900:[name]諏訪[line]Speaking of which, the Shibuya boy psychic thing also had a Darth Spider helmet, didn't it? Takumi Nishijo, was that the kid's name?[%p]"

msgid "4000:[name]諏訪[line]「なんで彼が、『集団ダイブ』の犯人と同じように、ダーススパイダーのヘルメット、持ってたんスかねえ？」[%p]"
msgstr "4000:[name]諏訪[line]Why would he have the same kind of Darth Spider helmet as the one used by the Group Dive killer?[%p]"

msgid "4100:[name]優愛[line]「…………っ」[%p]"
msgstr "4100:[name]優愛[line]...[%p]"

msgid "4200:その言葉を聞いた瞬間、優愛の中でどす黒い感情が一気に溢れ出した。[%p]"
msgstr "4200:When she heard those words, black emotions welled up inside her.[%p]"

msgid "4300:確信めいた思い。[%p]"
msgstr "4300:It was something like certainty now.[%p]"

msgid "4400:ついさっき、判たちに否定されていただけに、余計にその情報が自分の推察を完璧にするための、残された最後のピースだという気がした。[%p]"
msgstr "4400:Just a bit ago, Ban and Momose had been telling her that her theory was wrong. The fact that they'd rejected it only made her more certain now that this was the final piece of the puzzle.[%p]"

msgid "4500:[name]諏訪[line]「さてと、それじゃ自分、フリージアに行くんで。この辺で失礼しまッス」[%p]"
msgstr "4500:[name]諏訪[line]Anyway, I'm off to Freesia. See you around.[%p]"

msgid "4600:[name]諏訪[line]「フ……」[%p]"
msgstr "4600:[name]諏訪[line]Whew.[%p]"

msgid "4700:諏訪は言うだけ言って、手をヒラヒラと振りながら去っていった。[linebreak]１人残された優愛は、その場でうなだれ、立ち尽くす。[%p]"
msgstr "4700:After he was finished talking, Suwa waved and walked off. Yua was left alone. She stood there, unmoving, head slumped forward.[%p]"

msgid "4800:[name]優愛[line]「彼だわ……」[%p]"
msgstr "4800:[name]優愛[line]It's him.[%p]"

msgid "4900:ポツリと、誰にともなく小声でつぶやいていた。[%p]"
msgstr "4900:She whispered softly, to no one in particular.[%p]"

msgid "5000:[name]優愛[line]「彼なのよ」[%p]"
msgstr "5000:[name]優愛[line]He's the one.[%p]"

msgid "5100:[name]優愛[line]「やっぱり彼だった」[%p]"
msgstr "5100:[name]優愛[line]I knew it was him.[%p]"

msgid "5200:[name]優愛[line]「彼しかいない」[%p]"
msgstr "5200:[name]優愛[line]It has to be him.[%p]"

msgid "5300:[name]優愛[line]「彼に間違いない」[%p]"
msgstr "5300:[name]優愛[line]I'm sure it's him.[%p]"

msgid "5400:[name]優愛[line]「彼が、妹を、殺したのよ」[%p]"
msgstr "5400:[name]優愛[line]He killed my sister.[%p]"

msgid "5500:[name]優愛[line]「彼が、美愛を、殺したのよ……！」[%p]"
msgstr "5500:[name]優愛[line]He killed Mia.[%p]"
