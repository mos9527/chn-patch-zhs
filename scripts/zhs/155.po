msgid "0:ＡＨ東京総合病院の精神科診察室が入っているフロアには、静けさが訪れていた。[%p]"
msgstr "0:There was silence on the floor of AH Tokyo General Hospital where the psychiatric wards were located.[%p]"

msgid "100:外科や救急では、地震が起きて以来、原因不明の症状で意識を失った怪我人が続々と運び込まれていて、大変な状況だと言う。[%p]"
msgstr "100:The surgery and emergency wards were, supposedly, dealing with a rash of unexplainable comas that had started to occur after the earthquake.[%p]"

msgid "200:けれど精神科はその騒ぎにはまったく関係なく、外来の診察もいつもの時間より少し早く終わったほどだ。[%p]"
msgstr "200:But the psych ward had nothing to do with any of that. If anything, they'd finished up their outpatient exams a little earlier than scheduled.[%p]"

msgid "300:数日すれば、ＰＴＳＤになった可能性のある患者が詰めかけてくるのかもしれないが、少なくとも今日に限って言えば、精神科外来の業務はもうない。[%p]"
msgstr "300:A few days from now, they might have a flood of people experiencing PTSD from the quake, but for today, at least, there was nothing left for the outpatient staff to do.[%p]"

msgid "400:看護師である[ruby-base]葉月[ruby-text-start]はづき[ruby-text-end][ruby-base]志乃[ruby-text-start]しの[ruby-text-end]は、前日の夜勤からここまで働きづめで、ほとんど休憩を取っていないことに気付いた。お腹もすいている。[%p]"
msgstr "400:Shino Hazuki, one of the nurses, had been working here since last night's night shift, and belatedly realized she'd barely taken a break the whole time. She was hungry, too.[%p]"

msgid "500:先日、精神科は医師をひとり失い――ニュージェネ事件で無惨にも殺された――その補充要員もまだ来ていないので、ずっと人手不足なのだ。[%p]"
msgstr "500:The ward had lost one of its doctors the other day—he'd been murdered horribly in one of the NewGen incidents—and his replacement hadn't come yet, so there weren't enough people.[%p]"

msgid "600:だが今日の仕事で残っているのは細々とした雑用だけで、次の夜勤の看護師に引き継ぎ作業をすればようやくＯＦＦだ。[%p]"
msgstr "600:But all that was left for the day were a few minor tasks. She could hand them over to the night staff, and she'd finally be able to go home.[%p]"

msgid "700:さてもうひと頑張り、と自分の頬を両手で叩き、人がいなくなったロビーを足早に横切ろうとしたとき。[%p]"
msgstr "700:She slapped her cheeks with her hands, telling herself she just had to hang in there a little longer, and began to quickly walk across the lobby.[%p]"

msgid "800:ふと、彼女は背中から視線を感じた。[linebreak]うなじにチリチリとした感覚。ゾクリと腕に鳥肌が立つ。[%p]"
msgstr "800:Suddenly, she felt a gaze from behind. A prickling at the back of her neck. She shivered.[%p]"

msgid "900:反射的に、背後を振り返った。[linebreak]だが、その先には静まり返った廊下が続いているだけで、誰もいない。[%p]"
msgstr "900:She spun around out of sheer reflex. But there was nothing there but a quiet, empty hallway.[%p]"

msgid "1000:[name]葉月[line]「……？」[%p]"
msgstr "1000:[name]葉月[line]...?[%p]"

msgid "1100:[name]？？？[line]「看護師さん！」[%p]"
msgstr "1100:[name]？？？[line]Miss Nurse![%p]"

msgid "1200:[name]葉月[line]「キャッ……」[%p]"
msgstr "1200:[name]葉月[line]Kyah![%p]"

msgid "1300:まったく別の方向から飛んできた声に、葉月はビクッと身を震わせた。[%p]"
msgstr "1300:Hazuki was startled. The voice had come from completely the opposite of the direction she'd expected.[%p]"

msgid "1400:無人だと彼女が思い込んでいたロビーに、声の主はひとり残っていて、葉月の姿を見かけて声をかけてきたのだった。[%p]"
msgstr "1400:She'd thought the lobby was empty, but there was one person left. He'd called out to her when he'd seen her.[%p]"

msgid "1500:まだ幼さが残るものの、精悍な顔立ちをした男性だった。顔の血色もよく、とても病気をしているとは思えなかった。[%p]"
msgstr "1500:It was a man with a handsome, if still young, face. His pallor was healthy, and he certainly didn't look sick.[%p]"

msgid "1600:[name]葉月[line]「あなたは……」[%p]"
msgstr "1600:[name]葉月[line]You're...[%p]"

msgid "1700:[name]男[line]「ちょっと時間もらっていいッスか？」[%p]"
msgstr "1700:[name]男[line]Can I have a moment of your time?[%p]"

msgid "1800:[name]葉月[line]「はあ……」[%p]"
msgstr "1800:[name]葉月[line]I guess...[%p]"

msgid "1900:[name]男[line]「どもッス！」[%p]"
msgstr "1900:[name]男[line]Thanks![%p]"

msgid "2000:照れたように笑うと、男はいきなり葉月の腕をつかみ、ロビーから階段の方へと歩き出した。[%p]"
msgstr "2000:The man gave an embarrassed smile, and then suddenly grabbed her by the arm and pulled her from the lobby towards the stairs.[%p]"

msgid "2100:戸惑う葉月に、男――[ruby-base]諏訪[ruby-text-start]すわ[ruby-text-end][ruby-base]護[ruby-text-start]まもる[ruby-text-end]は懐から黒い手帳を出して控えめに掲げる。それは警察手帳だった。[%p]"
msgstr "2100:The man, Mamoru Suwa, took out a small black book from his pocket and showed it to her. He flipped it open and showed her his police ID.[%p]"

msgid "2200:諏訪は踊り場で立ち止まり、念には念を入れた様子で周囲を見回す。[%p]"
msgstr "2200:He stopped next to the stairs, and looked around carefully to make sure nobody was nearby.[%p]"

msgid "2300:[name]葉月[line]「それで、あの、お話って……」[%p]"
msgstr "2300:[name]葉月[line]So, um, what can I do for you?[%p]"

msgid "2400:葉月は、まだ仕事が残っていることもあって、少しソワソワした表情を見せた。[%p]"
msgstr "2400:She still had work to do, and was feeling a little uneasy.[%p]"

msgid "2500:諏訪もそれは分かっているらしく、前置きもなくポケットから一枚の写真を取り出す。[%p]"
msgstr "2500:Suwa seemed to realize this, so without wasting any more time, he took out a photo from his pocket and showed it to her.[%p]"

msgid "2600:[name]諏訪[line]「この少年に見覚えないッスか？」[%p]"
msgstr "2600:[name]諏訪[line]Do you recognize this boy?[%p]"

msgid "2700:そこに写っていたのは、西條拓巳の無気力そうな顔だった。職業柄、顔を覚えることについては自信がある葉月は、ついうなずいてしまう。[%p]"
msgstr "2700:It was a photo of a listless-looking Takumi Nishijo. Because of the nature of her work, Hazuki prided herself on being good with faces, and she nodded without even really thinking about whether it was okay to answer or not.[%p]"

msgid "2800:[name]諏訪[line]「西條拓巳……間違いないッスか？」[%p]"
msgstr "2800:[name]諏訪[line]Takumi Nishijo... You're sure?[%p]"

msgid "2900:[name]葉月[line]「え、ええ……でも……」[%p]"
msgstr "2900:[name]葉月[line]Y-Yes... But...[%p]"

msgid "3000:葉月の躊躇は、当然のことだった。[%p]"
msgstr "3000:Her hesitation was natural.[%p]"

msgid "3100:例え相手が警察とは言え、患者の情報を勝手に漏らすことは決していいことではない。[%p]"
msgstr "3100:Giving anyone, even the police, information about a patient was strictly against the rules.[%p]"

msgid "3200:だが諏訪としても、それは承知の上で葉月に話しかけたのだった。それまでの軽い態度を改め、真剣な眼差しを浮かべる。そして、声を潜めて切り出した。[%p]"
msgstr "3200:But of course, Suwa had known that when he'd talked to her. His casual attitude suddenly vanished, and a serious look appeared on his face. He dropped his voice as he spoke.[%p]"

msgid "3300:[name]諏訪[line]「頼みがあるんスけど……」[%p]"
msgstr "3300:[name]諏訪[line]I need you to do me a favor.[%p]"

msgid "3400:[name]諏訪[line]「西條拓巳のカルテ、こっそり見せてもらえないッスか？」[%p]"
msgstr "3400:[name]諏訪[line]Can you show me Takumi Nishijo's medical records?[%p]"

msgid "3500:[name]葉月[line]「え、そんなの……無理です……できません……」[%p]"
msgstr "3500:[name]葉月[line]Huh? I can't... No. That's impossible.[%p]"

msgid "3600:[name]諏訪[line]「とある事件に関わる、重要なことなんスよ！」[%p]"
msgstr "3600:[name]諏訪[line]It could be the key to cracking the case![%p]"

msgid "3700:葉月はすっかり困り果ててしまい、たまらずその場から立ち去ろうとするが、諏訪に回り込まれて行く手を塞がれてしまう。[%p]"
msgstr "3700:Hazuki wasn't sure what to do. She turned to leave, but Suwa got in front of her and blocked her.[%p]"

msgid "3800:[name]葉月[line]「こ、困ります……」[%p]"
msgstr "3800:[name]葉月[line]P-Please leave me alone.[%p]"

msgid "3900:[name]諏訪[line]「迷惑はかけないッス！　だから頼んまスよ！」[%p]"
msgstr "3900:[name]諏訪[line]I'll make sure it doesn't get back to you! So please![%p]"

msgid "4000:ついには、諏訪はその場に膝をついて、土下座し始めた。[%p]"
msgstr "4000:Finally, he got on his knees and began to beg.[%p]"

msgid "4100:[name]葉月[line]「や、やめてください、本当に……無理なんです……」[%p]"
msgstr "4100:[name]葉月[line]S-Stop it... Really, I can't.[%p]"

msgid "4200:[name]諏訪[line]「これ以上、犠牲者を出さないためにも……！」[%p]"
msgstr "4200:[name]諏訪[line]I need your help to make sure nobody else gets killed![%p]"

msgid "4300:[name]葉月[line]「…………」[%p]"
msgstr "4300:[name]葉月[line]...[%p]"

msgid "4400:いったいどうすればあきらめてくれるのかしら――[%p]"
msgstr "4400:What could she do to make him give up?[%p]"

msgid "4500:葉月にはいい断りの文句が思い浮かばず、[linebreak]ただオロオロとするしかなかった。[%p]"
msgstr "4500:Hazuki couldn't come up with anything, so she just stood there helplessly.[%p]"

msgid "4600:諏訪と葉月は不意に黙り込み、天井へと目を向けた。[%p]"
msgstr "4600:Suwa and Hazuki both suddenly fell silent, and then looked up to the ceiling.[%p]"

msgid "4700:それから互いに目配せをする。[%p]"
msgstr "4700:Then they both gave each other a knowing glance.[%p]"

msgid "4800:[name]諏訪[line]「ふう」[%p]"
msgstr "4800:[name]諏訪[line]Whew.[%p]"

msgid "4900:諏訪がため息をついたのを合図に、葉月も顔に浮かべていた困惑顔を消す。[%p]"
msgstr "4900:Suwa sighed, and the bothered expression vanished from Hazuki's face.[%p]"

msgid "5000:[name]諏訪[line]「……見られていたな」[%p]"
msgstr "5000:[name]諏訪[line]They saw us.[%p]"

msgid "5100:[name]葉月[line]「その目だれの目、ね」[%p]"
msgstr "5100:[name]葉月[line]Whose eyes are those, right?[%p]"

msgid "5200:唐突に、２人の交わす言葉に馴れ馴れしさが混じった。[linebreak]旧知の仲としか思えない感情が、その言葉の端々に込められていた。[%p]"
msgstr "5200:The two were suddenly speaking as if they were friendly with each other. There was something in their words that made it clear they'd known each other for a long time.[%p]"

msgid "5300:[name]諏訪[line]「ニシジョウタクミのオリジナルは見つかったか？」[%p]"
msgstr "5300:[name]諏訪[line]Did you find Takumi Nishijo's original?[%p]"

msgid "5400:[name]葉月[line]「いいえ。この病院内にいることは分かっているのに」[%p]"
msgstr "5400:[name]葉月[line]No. It's clear he's somewhere in the hospital, though.[%p]"

msgid "5500:[name]葉月[line]「これ、カルテよ。彼は夢遊病だわ」[%p]"
msgstr "5500:[name]葉月[line]This is the chart. He's a sleepwalker.[%p]"

msgid "5600:さっきまであれほど渡すのを渋っていたにもかかわらず、葉月はそのカルテをあっさりと諏訪に渡した。[%p]"
msgstr "5600:She handed him the chart, despite her reluctance to do it a moment ago.[%p]"

msgid "5700:まるで諏訪が訪れるのを予想していたかのように、彼女は手元にカルテを用意までしていた。[%p]"
msgstr "5700:She'd had it on her, as if she'd known he was going to come.[%p]"

msgid "5800:[name]諏訪[line]「助かる」[%p]"
msgstr "5800:[name]諏訪[line]Thanks.[%p]"

msgid "5900:[name]諏訪[line]「じゃ、予定通りにＯ－ＦＲＯＮＴにヤツを誘導して、覚醒させるか」[%p]"
msgstr "5900:[name]諏訪[line]Okay, time to lure him to O-FRONT and awaken him, as planned.[%p]"

msgid "6000:[name]葉月[line]「接触するの？」[%p]"
msgstr "6000:[name]葉月[line]You're going to make contact with him?[%p]"

msgid "6100:[name]諏訪[line]「ああ。顔は隠すけどな」[%p]"
msgstr "6100:[name]諏訪[line]Yeah. I'll cover my face, though.[%p]"

msgid "6200:諏訪はいたずらげに笑うと、葉月の唇に軽くキスをした。[%p]"
msgstr "6200:He gave her a mischievous smile, and then gave her a quick kiss on the lips.[%p]"

msgid "6300:[name]諏訪[line]「コスプレしてパーティーに出発だ」[%p]"
